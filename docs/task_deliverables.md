  end

    D --> E[Time-series Database]
    D --> F[Blockchain Logger]
    E --> G[Analytics Engine]
    F --> H[Compliance Dashboard]
  end
  G --> H
```

**Components:**

* **Sensor Nodes (A):** RFID, weight, purity, location sensors attached to gold shipments.
* **Gateway (B):** Edge compute for local aggregation, buffering, and secure MQTT forwarding.
* **Central Broker (C):** Scalable MQTT broker with TLS encryption.
* **Ingestion Service (D):** Validates, transforms, and routes data to storage and blockchain.
* **Time-series DB (E):** InfluxDB/TimescaleDB for sensor metrics.
* **Blockchain Logger (F):** Hyperledger Fabric smart contract for immutable audit.
* **Analytics Engine (G):** ML models for anomaly detection and compliance scoring.
* **Dashboard (H):** Real-time web UI for compliance officers.

## 2. Prototype: School Placement Algorithm (Python)

```python
# northland_school_placement.py
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Load student and school data
students = pd.read_csv('students.csv')
schools = pd.read_csv('schools.csv')

# Compute match score based on preferences and vacancies
def compute_match(student, school):
    score = 0
    # merit flag
    score += student['aggregate_score'] / 100
    # proximity bonus
    score += (1 - student['distance_to_school'] / 100)
    # program preference
    score += 1 if school['program'] in student['preferences'].split(',') else 0
    return score

# Build matching
assignments = []
for _, student in students.iterrows():
    # rank schools by score with vacancies
    viable = schools[schools.vacancies > 0]
    viable['score'] = viable.apply(lambda s: compute_match(student, s), axis=1)
    best = viable.sort_values('score', ascending=False).iloc[0]
    assignments.append({'student': student.id, 'school': best.id})
    # decrement vacancy
    schools.loc[schools.id == best.id, 'vacancies'] -= 1

# Save assignments
pd.DataFrame(assignments).to_csv('assignments.csv', index=False)
```

*Usage:* Adjust scoring weights and include government quotas or special cases as needed.
