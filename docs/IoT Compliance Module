IoT Compliance Module

📘 Project Title

Northland Analytics – IoT Compliance & Certification System (NICCS)

🧩 Overview

The IoT Compliance Module is a national infrastructure designed to certify, audit, and enforce compliance of all IoT-enabled devices entering or operating within Ghana. It ensures that all industrial, consumer, and infrastructural IoT hardware adheres to approved safety, environmental, and data policies before integration into national or private networks.

This system supports multiple sectors: mining, agriculture, logistics, smart homes, telecoms, and manufacturing.

🎯 Objectives

* Enforce compliance for all imported or deployed IoT devices.
* Provide a certification system for device manufacturers and vendors.
* Integrate with customs and regulatory systems (Energy Commission, EPA, Standards Authority).
* Track IoT devices in use by sector (e.g., gold mining, agriculture).
* Log firmware versioning and hardware standards.

 

🧱 System Architecture

 Key Components:

* Device Registration API – for manufacturers, vendors, or integrators.
* Customs Integration API – to flag or approve imports at entry ports.
* Firmware Integrity Scanner – validates firmware hashes or versions.
* QR/NFC Device ID Tags – for end-user or regulator verification via mobile/web apps.
* Compliance Dashboard – used by national regulators to monitor fleet usage.

 Technologies:

* Backend: Node.js (NestJS) / Python (FastAPI)
* Frontend: Next.js / React
* DB: PostgreSQL with TypeORM
* Messaging: RabbitMQ / Redis Streams
* IoT Gateway: MQTT, HTTP Device Telemetry
* Identity: OAuth2 + Device-level PKI
* Hosting: Azure GovCloud / Local NITA servers

🔐 Core Functionalities

 ✅ Device Certification Workflow

1. Vendor submits device specs (chipset, firmware hash, protocols, origin).
2. System checks against predefined compliance rules.
3. Manual review by authorities (if required).
4. Certification is issued, rejected, or marked for updates.

 📦 Customs Integration

* Scanning NFC or QR code on incoming IoT devices.
* Shows compliance status (Approved / Blocked / Expired).
* Geo-tagged logs for all customs scans.

 🛰️ Telemetry Hooks

* Approved devices optionally send metadata (non-personal) for runtime auditing.
* Alerts triggered if firmware is outdated or device behaves anomalously.

 🧾 Reporting

* Monthly device compliance logs per industry.
* Real-time dashboard for policy violations.

 

🛠️ APIs

 POST /devices/register

Registers new device for compliance check.

 GET /devices/{id}/status

Returns the device’s current compliance status.

 PATCH /devices/{id}/firmware

Submit new firmware version for evaluation.

 GET /customs/scan/{tagId}

Allows customs to scan and validate the device.

 

📱 Mobile App Feature Highlights

* QR/NFC scanner for customs and regulators
* Offline support with sync-on-connect
* Notifications to vendors on expiring certifications

 

📈 Future Features

* Blockchain certification ledger for tamper-proof logs
* AI-based anomaly detection for active device fleets
* Integration with UN standards and ECOWAS digital compliance framework
