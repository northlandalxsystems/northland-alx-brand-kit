IoT Compliance Module

Overview

The IoT Compliance Module is a pluggable system designed to ensure regulatory, operational, and business rule compliance of IoT-enabled devices within platforms such as GoldBod Systems, Agritech deployments, and other Northland Analytics projects. The module ingests data from remote sensors, validates it in real time, and triggers alerts, logs, or automated actions when violations are detected.


Features

* ✅ Real-time data ingestion from IoT devices
* ✅ Rules engine for customizable compliance logic
* ✅ Hardware-level trust validation (firmware check, device ID match)
* ✅ Location & timestamp verification
* ✅ Automated alerts via webhook, email, or dashboard
* ✅ Compliance reports and logs exportable (PDF, JSON, CSV)
* ✅ Secure API endpoints for third-party platform integration
* ✅ Admin portal with visual compliance dashboard
* ✅ Configurable thresholds (temperature, location, signal, etc.)
* ✅ Offline sync queue for intermittent connectivity scenarios



Use Cases

* Gold Storage Monitoring: Ensuring temperature, motion, and access patterns match compliance standards.
* Agricultural Moisture Control: Soil sensor readings must remain within defined thresholds.
* Fleet & Logistics Tracking: Route deviation detection, battery status compliance, and unauthorized stop alerts.
* Remote Energy Compliance: Solar panel performance and battery voltage verification with alerting.
