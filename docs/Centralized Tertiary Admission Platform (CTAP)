 📘 Centralized Tertiary Admission Platform (CTAP)

Northland Analytics – Project 3  
> A unified, government-backed admission management system integrating all Ghanaian tertiary institutions.

 🗂️ README
 📄 What is CTAP?

The Centralized Tertiary Admission Platform (CTAP) is a national system developed to handle all undergraduate admission processes across public, private, and technical universities in Ghana. It guarantees a fair, efficient, and data-driven admission process, leveraging technology to match students based on merit, preferences, and institutional capacity.

 🧰 Features Summary

- Fully automated student-to-university matching engine.
- WAEC result verification via API integration with `waecgh.org`.
- Unified student portal and university dashboards.
- Integrated payment gateway (Paystack, Mobile Money).
- Role-based access for government, universities, and applicants.
- Real-time analytics and policy tracking for the Ministry of Education.

 🚀 Deployment & Tech Stack

- Backend: NestJS (Node.js), PostgreSQL, TypeORM, Docker
- Frontend: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions → Azure Cloud
- Security: JWT Authentication, RBAC, Encrypted WASSCE lookups

 📈 Why CTAP Matters

- Stops duplication and manipulation of admissions.
- Promotes equal access to tertiary education.
- Enables government subsidy automation for less enrolled universities.
- Fosters regional equity in education access.

 🧪 Dev Notes

This project is under active development and currently in the integration testing phase with sample university partners.  
A public pilot is planned for launch with 3 institutions in Q3 2025.

 📌 Project Overview

The Centralized Tertiary Admission Platform (CTAP) is a nationwide admission matching and management system designed to integrate private, public, and technical universities across Ghana. CTAP provides a unified and optimized approach to student admissions, ensuring fair distribution, resource optimization, and universal access to tertiary education.

 🎯 Objectives

- Ensure efficient, merit-based, and timely student placement.
- Avoid underutilization of university resources.
- Eliminate duplicate or conflicting admission offers.
- Provide real-time tracking and analytics for government education bodies.
- Serve as a mandatory admission gateway with government subsidy mechanisms.

 🏗 System Architecture
 🔧 Backend Stack

- Node.js with NestJS
- PostgreSQL with TypeORM
- RESTful API and GraphQL
- Authentication: JWT + Role-based access
- WAEC Result Integration: Verified access to `waecgh.org`
 🌐 Frontend Stack

- React with Next.js
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand / Redux Toolkit for state management
- Axios or GraphQL Client
 ☁️ Deployment

- Hosted on Microsoft Azure
- Dockerized using Docker + Docker Compose
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions

 🔑 Core Features
 1. Admission Matching Algorithm
- Based on first-come-first-serve and merit-based filtering.
- Prioritizes student choices in order of preference.
- Redistributes unmatched students automatically to qualified but less competitive institutions.
 2. University Panel
- Can review, accept, or reject incoming applications.
- Monitor application flow in real-time.
- Manage departmental quotas and preferences.
 3. Government Admin Dashboard
- View application trends across all institutions.
- Manage compensation logic for under-enrolled schools.
- Generate national reports for education policy planning.
 4. Payment Integration
- Paystack & Mobile Money APIs for application fees.
- Flexible logic to waive fees for scholarships or policy-based exceptions.
 5. WAEC Result Verification
- API checks authenticity of student WASSCE results directly from WAEC Ghana (`waecgh.org`).
- Eliminates fake result submissions.

 🔁 Flow of Operation

1. Student signs up and inputs program choices + WAEC results.
2. WAEC verification occurs via API.
3. CTAP algorithm matches the student to top available option based on:
   - Grades
   - Available slots
   - Program competitiveness
4. If no match, system proposes alternatives.
5. University receives and approves or redirects.
6. Government monitors fill rates and redistributes where needed.

 🧠 Smart Distribution Logic
 Principles
- Fairness: No university is left underutilized.
- Efficiency: High-performing students matched to top programs.
- Inclusiveness: Regional, technical, and private universities included.
 Parameters Considered
- WAEC results
- Student program priority
- Time of application
- Institutional quota
- Demand/Supply balancing

 💡 ML and Data Insights

- Predictive analytics on program demand trends.
- University performance heatmaps.
- Suggests new program creation areas.
- Feedback loop trains placement models over time.
